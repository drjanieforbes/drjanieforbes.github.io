What I hope to accomplish with this blog is to feature open-access research projects that I am currently working on.

This site is built with Jekyll, which offers powerful support for code snippets:

Ruby:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

R:
{% highlight r %}
# using google, this will return lat/lon for Baltimore, Maryland
CenterOfMap <- geocode("Baltimore, MD")
# get the google map of Baltimore
Baltimore <- get_map(c(lon=CenterOfMap$lon, lat=CenterOfMap$lat),zoom = 12,
    maptype = "terrain",
    source = "google")
my.base.map <- ggmap(Baltimore)
{% endhighlight %}

Python:
{% highlight python %}
try:
    z = int(x) + int(y)     # if successful, z will contain the sum
except ValueError:
    # nope, there's a problem
    print('x or y or both contain at least one non-digit character')
    z = -1

print('%s + %s is: %s' %(str(x),str(y),str(z)))
{% endhighlight %}
