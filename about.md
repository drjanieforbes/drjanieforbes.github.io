#### > RELATED PROFESSIONAL SKILLS

I am proficient in data transformation, data handling, data manipulation, and data analysis, based on years of experience in programming. My current programming/scripting proficiencies are in Python and open source R (The R Project for Statistical Computing), with experience in Matlab (including image processing) and previous experience in FORTRAN.

For spatial and image analysis, I am proficient in ESRI ArcGIS 9.x/10.x.  I am proficient in ERDAS Imagine; and ENVI for image analysis and processing. For statistical analysis, I am proficient with SPSS and R. For spatial statistical analysis I am proficient in both ArcGIS/ArcINFO and R. In addition to these proficiencies, I am familiar with Definiens eCognition for object-based image analysis, and the use of both ArcGIS and FUSION for LiDAR data analysis. I am also proficient in the Microsoft Office suite of products, as well as having basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery.
